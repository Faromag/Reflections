What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a file.  so we can start some git tools

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 

It is whats held in the commit before it is committed vs the working directory has all the files 

What value do you think it offers?
great organization to see what is to be committed.
